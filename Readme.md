| Argument    |  Description|
| ----------- | ----------- 
|    `-bib`    | DOI to get bibtex entry |
|    `-ref`    | DOI to get bibtex entries for all the references |

|    `-ren`    | PDF file name(s) to rename with bibtex info | 
|    `-dup`    | Bib file name(s) to find duplicates. | 
|    `-o`      | Output bib file | 

* Get bibtex from a DOI

    ```
* Get bibtex from a DOI and store in a file 'ref.bib'
    ```bash
    kbib -bib https://doi.org/10xxxxxx -o ref.bib
    ```
* Get the full reference list of an article as bibtex entries and save as ref.bib
    ```bash
    kbib -ref https://doi.org/10xxxxxx -o ref.bib
    ```
* Get bibtex from a PDF named article.pdf
    ```bash
    kbib -pdf article.pdf
    ```
* Get bibtex from all pdfs in the current folder
    ```bash
    kbib -pdf *.pdf
    ```
* Rename pdf files with bibtex information
    ```bash
    kbib -ren article.pdf
    # or
    kbib -ren *.pdf

#### ‚öìLimitation:
- `kbib` parses DOI information from [Crossref API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc). So if the article is not indexed in Crossref database this tool will fail to get the necessary information. Also the API may temporarily block requests from an IP if a large number of queries are made within a short period of time.
- Special/Latex characters in the title may gets messed up during the API call. One needs to be careful using title field for the bibtex created by `kbib`.
- For bibtex keys and renaming files, `kbib` uses format as `<Short Journal Name>_<Volume>_<Year>_<Last name of first author>`, which is presently hardcoded in the tool. Therefore, one can not use any desired format through the command line.


#### ‚è≥ Work-in-Progress:
- Concurrent/Parallel API calls for faster parsing of bibtex information.
