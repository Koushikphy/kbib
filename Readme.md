```
For paring bibtex information from PDF files, optional dependencies need to be installed

pip install kbib['pdf']
```



### âš¡ Features
1. Get bibtex entry from DOI.
3. Get bibtex entry from article pdf.
2. Get full list of references of an article as bibtex entries.



### ðŸš€ Usage 
Use the command line tool `kbib` as 
```bash
kbib [-h] [-bib DOI] [-ref DOI] [-o DOI]
```

| Argument    |  Description|
| ----------- | ----------- 
|    `-bib`     |DOI to get bib entry  |
|    `-ref`     | DOI to get bib entries for all the references | 
|    `-pdf`     | PDF file name(s) to get DOI | 
|    `-o`      | Output bib file | 


#### Limitation:
Currently it parses DOI information from Crossref API (api.crossref.org). So if the article is not indexed in Crossref database this tool will fail to get the necessary information.


#### Work-in-Progress:
Concurrent API calls for faster parsing of bibtex information.
