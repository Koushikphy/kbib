#### ‚öìLimitation:
Currently it parses DOI information from [Crossref API](https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc). So if the article is not indexed in Crossref database this tool will fail to get the necessary information.


#### ‚öí Work-in-Progress:
1. Concurrent API calls for faster parsing of bibtex information.
2. Set bibtex entry keys in a predefined format.
3. Ise abbreviated journal names.
